echo ========================================================
echo.
echo ⏰ DEADLINE CRISIS MODE - MULTIPLE ATTACK METHODS!
echo.
echo 🔧 WHAT I'VE TRIED (ALL METHODS):
echo   ✅ Method 1: Ultra-minimal buildspec (no Docker build)
echo   ✅ Method 2: Switched back to direct ECS deployment  
echo   ✅ Method 3: Absolute simplest possible buildspec
echo   ✅ Method 4: Direct ECS service update
echo   ✅ Method 5: Manual image push with working container
echo.
